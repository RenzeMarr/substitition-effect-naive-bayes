    "## Naive Bayes: Limes and Lemons Shop\n",

    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will use **Naive Bayes**—a probabilistic model based on Bayes' theorem—to adjust transaction quantities by considering how stock-outs influence purchasing behavior. Specifically, we will focus on how the probability of purchasing Product A (e.g., lemons) changes when Product B (e.g., limes) is out of stock. This model allows us to calculate a correction ratio that adjusts the observed sales data, ensuring our definition of demand is more accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The correction ratio is the ratio between two posterior probabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The probability of purchasing Product A when all products are available.\n",
    "- The probability of purchasing Product A when Product B is out of stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the probability of purchasing lemons is 0.5 when limes are available but increases to 0.8 when limes are out of stock, we can adjust the lemon transactions by applying a correction factor of 0.5 / 0.8 = 0.625. This adjustment helps prevent overforecasting lemon demand due to the stock-out of limes."
